The main object of this portfolio is to introduce me to github, and start my project build up. This project is first starting with my Data Science 250 projects, and my resume. This is my first semester (Jan to Apr 2024) working with HTML and github and my second semester working with Python. I’m fairly new to coding and or computer science, but computer science was my career choice up until 9th grade so I’m able to understand many of the coding languages fairly quickly.\n\n\nI made a few models and projects for my Intermediate Macroeconomics course, and hopefully I can uopload them to this portfolio by the end of the semester. I also made one CFA institute research for a US firm and hope to upload it here as well."

    "text": "Looking up an Equity - Amazon - AMZN\nYou can search by typing in the blue box field by either typing the name of the company or the stock name.\nHere is a sample using the company name\n\nHere is a sample using the company stock name\n\nNote: Sometimes searching by stock name can be faster and clear any confusion due to companies having similar or same names.\nIn most BYUI courses, you will always pick ‘US equity’ when looking up a company so all the other options can be ignored for now. Once you understand Bloomberg, then the other options will come in handy.\nSo we select ‘AMZN US Equity’ in this case.\nSecurity Description\nThe next image is a pop-up screen that appears after selecting AMZN US Equity. It will have many options, and many of the Bloomberg functions you will be using in the society and throughout the courses that require the use of Bloomberg will be in this pop-up menu.\n\nUnder Company Overview, we select ‘DES Security Description’ to view the about of a company and other key details. The image below shows what the DES Security Description should look like in your Bloomberg terminal.\nIn this screen, you can find many useful pieces of information about a company, including the tab for ratios.\nNote: once you search an equity or index in the Bloomberg terminal, it will be loaded automatically for any functions you search. Notice when you open a new tab, in the top left you can see “AMAZON.COM INC equity” so any related function you search in Bloomberg will be loaded using the currently loaded equity or index.\n\n\n\nFinacial Analysis of AMZN\nTo view the FA for AMZN, just search ‘FA’ in the blue box. You can do it on the DES page or just open a new tab.\nIf I could recommend any of you to familiarize yourself with any Bloomberg function, this would be one of the main ones and will make your life easier, even for non-financial econ and/or econ courses.\n\nOverview.\n\nIncome Statement\nBalance Sheet\nCash Flow\nRatios\nand my favorite ‘Custom’\n\n\nThis is like the best place to find ratios and specific information about a company.\n\nCreate Custom\nSave it after a few fields have been entered even if you are not done, because leaving that page will delete any unsaved progress.\n\n\nWAY TO MANY OPTIONS IN BLOOMBERG\n\nWhen doing course assignments, explain how you attain the ratios or fields due to ratios having different values.\n\n\nRight click on a field and select ‘definition’.\n\nMost of the time, the definition of a field will let you know if you are looking at the correct field for your research project.\n\nAdd as many fields as needed.\n\nRight next to the ‘’ option, you have the save option.\n\nPick a name for your template and save it.\nPick names that can be easily indentified even semesters later.\nDelete any one time use templates.\n\n\nTo edit a saved template, simply enter a field normally and remember to save.\n\n\nThroughout your courses, you will always be doing repetitive tasks in Excel. So, it will be useful to create an Excel template where you can simply copy and paste from a Bloomberg export Excel file into your model. As you improve your research skills, having an Excel model that automatically performs calculations and predictions on given data will make your student life a lot easier.\n\nMany of the definitions on the Bloomberg Terminal will provide you with the calculations for the function you are using.\n\n\n\npsacer\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",
