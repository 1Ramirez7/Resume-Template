# Looking up an Equity - Amazon - AMZN


You can search by typing in the blue box field by either typing the name of the company or the stock name.

Here is a sample using the company name

Here is a sample using the company stock name

Note: Sometimes searching by stock name can be faster and clear any confusion due to companies having similar or same names.

In most BYUI courses, you will always pick 'US equity' when looking up a company so all the other options can be ignored for now. Once you understand Bloomberg, then the other options will come in handy.

So we select 'AMZN US Equity' in this case.

__Security Description__

The next image is a pop-up screen that appears after selecting AMZN US Equity. It will have many options, and many of the Bloomberg functions you will be using in the society and throughout the courses that require the use of Bloomberg will be in this pop-up menu.

Under Company Overview, we select 'DES Security Description' to view the about of a company and other key details. The image below shows what the DES Security Description should look like in your Bloomberg terminal.

In this screen, you can find many useful pieces of information about a company, including the tab for ratios.

Note: once you search an equity or index in the Bloomberg terminal, it will be loaded automatically for any functions you search. Notice when you open a new tab, in the top left you can see "AMAZON.COM INC equity" so any related function you search in Bloomberg will be loaded using the currently loaded equity or index.

# Finacial Analysis of AMZN

To view the FA for AMZN, just search 'FA' in the blue box. You can do it on the DES page or just open a new tab.

If I could recommend any of you to familiarize yourself with any Bloomberg function, this would be one of the main ones and will make your life easier, even for non-financial econ and/or econ courses.

Overview. 

- Income Statement

- Balance Sheet

- Cash Flow

- Ratios

- and my favorite 'Custom'

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1Ramirez7/Portfolio_/main/Images/SS/6_FA%20screen.png)

This is like the best place to find ratios and specific information about a company.

- Create Custom 

- Save it after a few fields have been entered even if you are not done, because leaving that page will delete any unsaved progress.

__WAY TO MANY OPTIONS IN BLOOMBERG__ 

- When doing course assignments, explain how you attain the ratios or fields due to ratios having different values.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1Ramirez7/Portfolio_/main/Images/SS/8_FA_adding.png)

Right click on a field and select 'definition'. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1Ramirez7/Portfolio_/main/Images/SS/9_FA_RightClick.png)

Most of the time, the definition of a field will let you know if you are looking at the correct field for your research project.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1Ramirez7/Portfolio_/main/Images/SS/10_FA_definition.png)

Add as many fields as needed.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1Ramirez7/Portfolio_/main/Images/SS/11_FA_Q_VS_Y.png)

Right next to the '<Enter field>' option, you have the save option. 

- Pick a name for your template and save it. 
 - Pick names that can be easily indentified even semesters later. 
 - Delete any one time use templates. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1Ramirez7/Portfolio_/main/Images/SS/12_FA_save.png)

To edit a saved template, simply enter a field normally and remember to save.

Throughout your courses, you will always be doing repetitive tasks in Excel. So, it will be useful to create an Excel template where you can simply copy and paste from a Bloomberg export Excel file into your model. As you improve your research skills, having an Excel model that automatically performs calculations and predictions on given data will make your student life a lot easier.

Many of the definitions on the Bloomberg Terminal will provide you with the calculations for the function you are using.
